As education shifts towards technology, the traditional classroom attendance method, often involving tedious roll calls or sign-in sheets, has become less effective. Additionally, students might sign-in for absent peers, leading to inaccuracies. Addressing this, our team proposes a Classroom Sign-In System for Queen's University, designed to simplify and optimize the attendance process using real-time software technology. The primary objective of this system is to provide professors with an efficient method to monitor student participation.  

  
The system, developed as a web application, allows students to sign in using a unique PIN provided in lectures, verifying their presence using GPS technology to ensure they are physically close to the lecture venue. Following lectures, instructors can access comprehensive attendance records, with options to export the data for in-depth analysis.
